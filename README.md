# HardcoreMode---An-AzerothCore-Module

**work in progress**

This module is intended for people wanting to force hardcore mode on thier server.
Every character that is created will be forced into this mode and it is not able to be turned off (unless in the config server side)

In the event that your character dies you will not be able to restore the character.
The server will also send a message to all players online which character has died and how they died.

There are some variables that would be great to add in the future like sending all dead characters to an island, or marking their death forever, but that's future vision only for now.
